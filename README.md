# Road-Lane-line-detection
Lane Line detection is a critical component for self driving cars and also for computer vision in general. This concept is used to describe the path for self-driving cars and to avoid the risk of getting in another lane.
In this article, we will build a machine learning project to detect lane lines in real-time. We will do this using the concepts of computer vision using OpenCV library. To detect the lane we have to detect the white markings on both sides on the lane.

Road Lane-Line Detection with Python & OpenCV.

Using computer vision techniques in Python, we will identify road lane lines in which autonomous cars must run. This will be a critical part of autonomous cars, as the self-driving cars should not cross itâ€™s lane and should not go in opposite lane to avoid accidents.
